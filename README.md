### Project Overview
##### This project aims to analyze and visualize UN Volunteer data to gain valuable insights for effective management and decision-making. The analysis incorporates data about volunteers, their locations, and organizational details. Using DAX calculations, we create a comprehensive platform featuring interactive dashboards with insightful visualizations.

### Features
##### Date Table Creation: A dedicated Date table was created using DAX for time-based analysis.
##### Custom DAX Measures: Key metrics were calculated to derive insights as per requirements.
##### Data Transformation:
##### Contract Duration: Calculated contract duration in days/months.
##### Gender Columns: Added columns for Male (1 for male, 0 for female) and Female (1 for female, 0 for male).
##### Interactive Dashboards: Developed user-friendly dashboards with visually distinct colors and textures.
### Technologies Used
##### Power BI: For data modeling and visualization.
##### DAX: To create measures, calculated columns, and the Date table.
##### GitHub: For version control and repository management.
